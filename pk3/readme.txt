Description             : For a while now I have been developing a
                          modification to TPhentr's Doom 4 Weapon's mod
                          called Dumb 4, Which is meant to emulate the feel
                          and experience of the upcoming Doom 4 game.
                          
                          Still heavily in progress, with a truckload of
                          bugs, an explosion sound that doesn't even work, a
                          chaingun sound having a 50% chance of making a
                          firing sound, an exploitable double jump script,
                          and me trying to learn (and not even try) a bunch
                          of ACS, Dumb 4 is pretty messy in it's current
                          state, But I am willing for some constructive
                          criticism, some feedback and a few people to help
                          me with the project.
                          
                          This mod features new weapons, new monsters, and
                          new gameplay mechanics like double jumping. A lot
                          more is to be planned in the future, like a status
                          bar that isn't broken and a double jump that isn't
                          exploitable as heck.
