Dumb 4 - Git Release

Anyone wondered where this mod went? I haven't been working on it for a LONG time (yes that black box is still there). Last time I developed it was back in November 12, 2015, and where were only 2 major releases.

I'll rarely contribute to this repository because I want to focus on more bigger projects than a traditional Doom 2016 weapons and monsters mod. I may come back to contribute little things like the pistol, more balancing and overall a better experience. I would like to continute working on it but plans on bigger projects and SLADE3 not working on my new computer is pushing me back. I only created this Git repository incase if I or someone wanted to make tiny contributions. The first commit will just be Alpha 2 with extra unnessesary shit added.

HOW TO PLAY

-Get GZDoom. A real one, not a shitty one (O=http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/gzdoom/* X=http://forum.drdteam.org/viewforum.php?f=23*) or get Zandronum 3.0. This is less technologically advanced than GZDoom's Git releases but it is more multiplayer friendly than GZDoom. Dumb 4 was primarily designed for it. (https://zandronum.com/download) You may also get the original ZDoom which lacks the OpenGL-exclusive features. (O=http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/zdoom/* X=http://zdoom.org/Download*)
-Aquire doom2.wad or the Final Doom wads (tnt.wad and plutonia.wad). If you do not currently own them, Steam sells the entire classic trilogy for 20 US dollars. (http://store.steampowered.com/sub/18397/**) You may also use doom.wad but because Dumb 4 uses has DECORATE code that use Doom II's exclusive content you may encounter compatibility issues.
-If you are using Windows, Use _zip.bat and type in either pk3, zip or pk7 to compress all the content in the pk3 folder into a compressed file so you can play it. Unix and GNU/Linux users will have to wait. The alternative method for Unix and GNU/Linux users I know is to compress all files in the pk3 folder into a .zip folder with a file manager. Optional but you can change the file extension of the .zip file to .pk3 since .pk3's are basically .zip files with a different file extention.
-Drag the mod into the .exe file of the source port you are using. Alternatively you can edit the gzdoom-<username>.ini, zdoom-<username>.ini or zandronum-<username>.ini files to automatically load Dumb 4 on startup.
